# Big4_Financial_Risk_Compliance_Project

## Project Introduction
This project analyzes key metrics of the Big Four accounting firms (Deloitte, PwC, Ernst & Young, and KPMG) from 2020 to 2025. 
It primarily focuses on evaluating their audit performance, fraud detection capabilities, industry exposure, and the adoption of AI in auditing. 
The goal is to understand how these firms manage financial risk and to assess the impact of AI adoption on audit effectiveness and client satisfaction. 
The project involves data cleaning using Python and data visualization using Tableau to create interactive dashboards. 
And using SQL to provide insights into audit performance trends, industry-related fraud exposure, and patterns in AI implementation.
