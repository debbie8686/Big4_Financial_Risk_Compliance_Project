# Big4_Financial_Risk_Compliance_Project

## Project Introduction
This project analyzes key metrics of the Big Four accounting firms (Deloitte, PwC, Ernst & Young, and KPMG) from 2020 to 2025. 
It primarily focuses on evaluating their audit performance, fraud detection capabilities, industry exposure, and the adoption of AI in auditing. 
The goal is to understand how these firms manage financial risk and to assess the impact of AI adoption on audit effectiveness and client satisfaction. 
The project involves data cleaning using Python and data visualization using Tableau to create interactive dashboards. 
And using SQL to provide insights into audit performance trends, industry-related fraud exposure, and patterns in AI implementation.

## Business Objective
This analysis provides decision-makers with valuable business insights.

**Evaluating Audit Performance Trends:** 
It explores how audit engagements and the identification of high-risk cases have evolved over time within accounting firms.  
**Impact of AI Adoption on User Satisfaction:** 
It assesses whether the implementation of AI technologies has improved audit effectiveness and enhanced client satisfaction.  
**Fraud Detection Review:** 
By training AI models on historical fraud data and setting them to trigger alerts when patterns resemble past fraud cases, 
the system can effectively flag irregularities as potential signs of fraud.
